                <h1>I'm Michael</h1>
                <h2>I'm an engineering mentor, web developer and former teacher from the North of England</h2>
                <h3>I've had quite the journey. For a solid decade, I was a teacher, pouring my heart and soul into education. I loved connecting with students and inspiring them to learn. But, you know, my own love for technology just kept growing, and I couldn't ignore it any longer.</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="images/teaching.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px" alt="image" />
                    
                        
                

                </div>   
                
                <p> So, I took a leap of faith and transformed my career. Now, I'm a software engineer and loving every minute of it. I've always had a thing for design, a creative spark, and a real fascination with all things tech-related. So, it just felt right to dive headfirst into coding and software development.
                My experience as a teacher, with all its problem-solving and adaptability, has been a huge asset in this fast-paced tech world. I've quickly adapted to the industry, soaking up knowledge and constantly pushing my boundaries 
                But it's not just about me. I've also taken on a new role as an engineering mentor. Helping aspiring engineers navigate the complexities of coding and supporting their professional journeys is incredibly rewarding. It's my way of giving back and staying connected to my educational roots, albeit in a different way.</p>
                <p>In my downtime, you'll often find me deep in web design, exploring the latest tech innovations, and getting my hands dirty in the world of software development. My enthusiasm for all things tech isn't just a hobby; it's a reflection of my unwavering commitment to lifelong learning and my insatiable passion for the field.</p>
                My journey, from teacher to software engineer and mentor, is a testament to what's possible when you follow your heart. It shows that with determination, you can reinvent yourself and make a real impact in a brand new field. Education, technology, and design have become the pillars of my career, and I couldn't be happier.</p>
